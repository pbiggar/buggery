Why is is called 'buggery'?
==============================

When I conceived this, I was working on a patch to solve a bug, and was about to submit it to bugzilla. Clearly the word bug was on my mind. I then realized the nasty shell script I had hacked together wasn't sufficient, and that I needed to rewrite it in Python. I said 'bugger', an English term for 'drat' or 'darn' or 'fuckity-fuck fuck', and started writing the 'bugger' program. When I realized I had written this same program many times before, I repurposed it into a buggery file and the buggery language.

Any resemblence to my surname is coincidental.
