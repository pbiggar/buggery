Features I need to add:

# if it starts with a capital letter, display it#   if its a command with $$, display it
#   "display it" means show the command, then show the output. But also capture it.

# add 'exists(..) or/and/not' type syntax for predicates
#   it would also be worth caching dependencies via a timestamp/SHA-1 to rebuild (we need some of make's functionality, not much)

# allow comments in many more places

# multiple levels of indentation means continue the command or line
#     eg:
#       command: 
#         $ asdasd
#           --some-flag
#           --another-flag

#   capture all flags, and apply them
#     check they can be applied before running any commands
#     all paths

#   allow all python functions to be called by prefixing them with 'py'
#     pyos.paths 

# rename RETVAL to RESULT, ala Eiffel

# -v should go in, then out, maybe using indentation and '>' and '<'

# do we check that parameters are passed or defined globally? we should


Tests that need to be written:

# lots of test cases which don't raise, and which can be successfully parsed

# lost of case sensitive stuff. Everything must be lower case, except the first
# letter of top-level task definitions

# lots of bad naming. spaces, illegal chars,  etc. TODO: lots of test cases
# which don't raise, and which can be successfully parsed

# lost of case sensitive stuff. Everything must be lower case, except the first
# letter of top-level task definitions

# lots of bad naming. spaces, illegal chars,  etc.

# all the coverage stuff
