* Write buggery tutorial, reference and FAQ.

* Search up the hierarchy to find the first buggery file

* Keep processing buggery files as you go up the hierarchy?

* A -k flag to keep going after errors.

* Allow calling python functions.

* Define what operations result in what type

* Pattern matching instead of conditionals

* Checkpointing for lazy processing and saving time. Perhaps make notes of functions which can be checkpointed.

* Parallel processing. Perhaps files use semi-colons to separate files which can't be parallelized, instead of commas

* Turn the line parser into a real parser. This will mean # doesnt just break things, at the very least.
